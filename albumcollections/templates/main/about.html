                        It is the record store (a very extensive and inexpensive one), the record player (with 
                        great features like turning the record over for you), and your friend telling you what
                        new stuff to check out (who knows you weirdly well).
                    </p> 
                    <p> Spotify is also your strangely constructed record cabinet, providing you with infinite customizable 
                        shelves to store your singles (and ripped LP tracks) but only lending a single shelf with the appropriate
                        dimensions to store your LPs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Album Collections</i> is a project that seeks to fill this organizational gap. It represents additional
                        customizable shelves -- <i>collections</i> -- in your digital record cabinet. Whenever you're 
                        browsing the record store, you can take an album home with you to add to one of your collections. 
                        Then you can look through the albums on your shelves, rearrange them, pick out one to play
                        or even stack them on your record player to spin one after the other.
                    </p>

                        The <i>Mixtape</i> has had a fantastic modern representation for a long time. This app introduces the concept 
                        of <b>playlists for your albums</b>, bringing album enjoyment into the music subscription age.

                        main functionality of the app. Each section is labeled with an icon based on which app -- <i>Album Collections</i> and/or
