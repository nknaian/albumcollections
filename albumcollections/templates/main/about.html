                    <p>
                        It is the record store (a very extensive and inexpensive one), the record player (with 
                        great features like turning the record over for you), and your friend telling you what
                        new stuff to check out (who knows you weirdly well).
                    </p> 
                    <p> Spotify is also your strangely constructed record cabinet, providing you with infinitely customizable 
                        shelves to store your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)">Single</a>s but only lending 
                        a single shelf with the appropriate dimensions to store your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record">LP</a>s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Album Collections</i> is a project that seeks to fill this organizational gap. It represents additional
                        customizable shelves -- <i>collections</i> -- in your digital record cabinet. Whenever you're 
                        browsing the record store, you can take an album home with you to add to one of your collections. 
                        Then you can look through the albums on your shelves, rearrange them, shuffle them up and take them to the record player
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <i>Mixtape</i> has had a fantastic modern representation for a long time. This app introduces the concept 
                        of <b>playlists for your albums</b>, bringing album collection into the music subscription age.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="about_section" class="about_section">What is a collection?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Any playlist in your Spotify account can be represented in this app as a <i>collection</i>.
                        Here's an <a href="{{url_for('collection.index', playlist_id='4ucljWzVJnEB0cdWErJTsT')}}">example</a> of one. Within a 
                        collection, you can view the contents and link to the corresponding Spotify playlist and contained Spotify albums.
                        If you are logged in and own the playlist (free or premium account), then you can reorder (as long the full track list is
                        present) and remove albums from the playlist.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each section goes into detail on specific capabilities of the app. They are labeled with icons based on which application --
                        <i>Album Collections</i> and/or Spotify -- will be involved in the task. Note that as a prerequisite you will need
                        to have some playlists in your Spotify account with music (either full albums or individual tracks) that you want
                        to add as collections. You could also create some new empty playlists to start, and then add music after you've
                        added them as collections.

                    <p> <i>Album Collections</i> is a 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application">progressive web app</a>. Install it 
                        on your device/s via a browser for the smoothest experience. Offline capabilities are not currently supported
                        but are a possibility in the future.

                    <p> Press the <i>Login</i> button on the navbar or main page to authenticate with your Spotify account. 
                        This will allow you to view your Spotify playlists as <i>collections</i> and also enable collection playing and modifying.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="about_section">Add a Collection <img src="/static/favicon.ico" class="about_header_icon ps-1"/></h3>
                    <p>
                        Any playlists that you have added in your spotify account can be added as a collection via the form on the
                        <a href="{{url_for('main.index')}}">main page</a> (once logged in). The end result of the addition
                        process is that another playlist of yours will be accessible as a <i>collection</i> by clicking on it's
                        "shelf" on the main page. There are a couple options when adding a collection:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Create a copy of the source playlist to add as a collection. This could be helpful if the source
                                playlist is owned by someone else, because the copy will be part of your account and thus enable
                                reorder and remove actions from the collection. It also could be helpul in conjunction with the
                                below option of filling in missing album tracks, so that the original playlist is not modified.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Fill in missing album tracks. Any tracks missing from their respective albums will be inserted into
                                the playlist. An album in the playlist is only movable within the collection when
                                all tracks are present, in the correct order and not separated by tracks from other albums. This option
                                ensures that this is the case for all albums by modifying the playlist.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="about_section">Remove Collections <img src="/static/favicon.ico" class="about_header_icon ps-1"/> <img src="/static/images/spotify/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" class="about_header_icon ps-1"/></h3>
                    <p>
                        The collections that you have added via the above step can be removed as well, also from the
                        <a href="{{url_for('main.index')}}">main page</a> (when logged in). This will only remove the collection
                        from view in <i>Albums Collections</i>, it won't have any affect on the backing Spotify playlists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Collections can also be removed from view by deleting the underlying playlist in Spotify.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="about_section">Add album/s to a Collection <img src="/static/images/spotify/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" class="about_header_icon ps-1"/> <img src="/static/favicon.ico" class="about_header_icon ps-1"/></h3>
                    <p>
                        To add albums that aren't in any of your collections already to a collection, use Spotify.
                        Navigate to the album you'd like to add to the collection. In the options for the album, select 
                        <i>Add to playlist</i>, and choose the playlist corresponding to the collection you would like it
                        to be a part of. Alternatively in the desktop Spotify App, you can utilize the drag n' drop functionality 
                        to drag the album/s into the desired playlist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can add or <i>complete</i> albums already present in one of your collections from this app.
                        From your collection, click on the album you want to add and then press the
                        <img class="px-1" src="/static/images/bootstrap/plus.svg"/> button and choose a destination collection. This is a good way 
                        to move albums between collections, or fill in missing tracks in the album in the collection playlist to 'complete' it. 
                        This will not add a duplicate if an album already exists in an album. If that is desired, please use the Spotify app to do so.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="about_section">View your Collections <img src="/static/favicon.ico" class="about_header_icon ps-1"/></h3>
                    <p>
                        The main page on <i>Album Collections</i> displays the collections that you have added.
                        Click on a collection to open it. The collection page contains interactable cover art for the
                        contained albums, and has a <i>collection control bar</i> at the bottom that shows the name of
                        collection, along with several buttons to shufle, reorder, or access it in Spotify.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can also view any playlist in Spotify as a collection by manually inputting it's playlist id in the address
                        bar.<br>Ex: <code>{{url_for('collection.index', playlist_id='4ucljWzVJnEB0cdWErJTsT')}}</code>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="about_section">Reorder a Collection <img src="/static/favicon.ico" class="about_header_icon ps-1"/></h3>
                    <p>
                        The order of the albums in the collection can be changed via drag n' drop. This functionality
                        can be toggled using the <img class="px-1" src="/static/images/bootstrap/arrows-move.svg"/> button.
                        The order of the collection on the collection page reflects that order of the containing playlist.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="about_section">Shuffle a Collection <img src="/static/favicon.ico" class="about_header_icon ps-1"/></h3>
                    <p>
                        Press on the <img class="ps-1" src="/static/images/bootstrap/shuffle.svg"/> button to randomly change the order
                        of the albums in the collection. Under the hood this recreates the playlist using the album tracks already in the
                        collection. Note that because of this shuffling strategy, items that aren't music tracks (ex: podcast episodes) will
                        be removed from the playlist. If you'd like to retain an original source playlist containing podcast episodes then please
                        create a copy of the playlist when adding the collection.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="about_section">Remove an Album from a Collection <img src="/static/favicon.ico" class="about_header_icon ps-1"/></h3>
                    <p>
                        Click on the album you would like to remove from the collection. Then press the <img class="px-1" src="/static/images/bootstrap/trash.svg"/>
                        button, and respond to the 'are you sure' prompt. This will remove all songs from this album from the 
                        containing playlist, and remove the album art image from the screen.
                    </p>
